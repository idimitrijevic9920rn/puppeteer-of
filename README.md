This Node.js project provides an API endpoint to scrape and return content from a specific website (https://fansmetrics.com/) based on the provided location parameter. It uses Puppeteer with Stealth Plugin to simulate a non-headless browser, avoiding detection mechanisms on the target website. The service is designed to handle requests, perform web scraping tasks, and return structured data in JSON format.
